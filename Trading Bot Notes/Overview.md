## What is this project

I want to be able to run a program that will return a list of names that fit into my system and will be good plays.

I want this bot to also print why it picked it, eg.

**"Above the 50/21/9MA, recent higher high or higher low, tight squeeze..."**

I want to use this response for my journal.

## How will I do this
